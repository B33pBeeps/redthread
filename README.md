# redthread

A sticky-note pegboard for your terminal. Mouse-first, keyboard-friendly,
transparent over your tmux theme. ASCII-textured cork, dangling red
strings, smooth zoom, and multiple named boards you can switch between.

## What it is

- A small TUI meant to live in a tmux pane, always open.
- A cork pegboard rendered entirely in ASCII — your terminal background
  shows through, no solid fill.
- Sticky notes you drag with the mouse or nudge with the keyboard.
  Colored paper, red pin, ornate woven borders, paper-fiber flecks,
  drop shadow, fold glyph.
- **Red strings** between notes (or pinned to bare cork). Slack or
  tight. In-front-of or behind the notes. A weighted "swoop" while you
  pull the free end.
- **Multiple named boards** you cycle through like tmux windows
  (`work`, `personal`, `ideas`, …). Each board has its own notes,
  strings, zoom, font, highlight color, and a unique cork grain.
- **Workspace zoom** — 5 levels (`-3..+1`) that scale note sizes *and*
  positions, so you can pack many stickies into an overview or lean in
  on a few.
- **3D zoom-to-edit** — a smooth scale + lift + shadow animation that
  settles into a card with a live textarea.
- **9 paper tints + 9 highlight colors + 9 text styles** (Unicode math
  alphabets: plain, bold, italic, script, fraktur, double-struck,
  monospace, fullwidth, and bold-italic).
- Persists to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/redthread/notes.json` with debounced writes.

## Install

Requires **Go 1.23+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/B33pBeeps/redthread.git
cd redthread
go build -o redthread ./cmd/redthread
./redthread
```

Or:

```bash
go install github.com/B33pBeeps/redthread/cmd/redthread@latest
redthread
```

First run with no save file gets a small demo board. `redthread --fresh`
ignores the save and reseeds.

## Demos

### Notes & feel

Click without moving for a small jiggle, drag for a drop bounce, `tab`
cycles with the same jiggle, `enter` zooms into a card with a smooth 3D
transition, `esc` lands back with a thud.

### Red strings

Pull strings between notes (or to bare cork as wall-pins) — the free end
swoops behind the cursor with weight. `[ ]` cycles the hovered string;
`t` toggles tight / slack; `f` toggles in-front-of / behind notes; `x`
cuts. Strings stay visibly attached when you drag a note.

### Boards

Top tab bar shows all boards; each has its own cork grain so they feel
distinct. `>` / `<` cycle, `B` creates and drops you straight into rename,
`R` renames, `D D` deletes (two-press confirm).

| double-click | zoom-to-edit |
| click empty cork while pulling a string | place a wall-pin |

### Keyboard — board

| key | action |

| `tab` / `shift+tab` | cycle note selection |
| `← ↑ ↓ →` or `hjkl` | nudge (overshoots in motion direction) |
| `shift + ← ↑ ↓ →` | nudge ×5 |
| `enter` | zoom-to-edit |
| `n` / `d` / `r` | new / delete / raise note |

## Data

Notes live at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/redthread/notes.json`, defaulting to
`~/.local/share/redthread/notes.json`. Writes are debounced (400 ms) so
rapid drags coalesce into one flush.

A legacy `brainfartadhdfixerupper/` directory auto-migrates on first
launch under the new name. v3 single-board files migrate forward into
the v4 workspace envelope.

Schema (v4):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 4,
  "activeIdx": 0,
  "boards": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "grainSeed": 1777118907643042768,
      "zoom": 0,
      "textMode": 0,
      "highlightColor": 0,
      "notes":   [ { "id": "…", "title": "…", "body": "…",
                     "x": 3, "y": 1, "tint": "yellow",
                     "created": "…", "updated": "…" } ],
      "strings": [ { "a": { "note": "idA" }, "b": { "note": "idB" },
                     "tight": false, "front": false } ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Customizing

Color palettes and text styles live in `internal/app/theme.go`:

- `Tints` + `TintOrder` — the 9 paper colors.
- `SelBorderChoices` — the 9 highlight colors.
- `TextModes` — the Unicode-alphabet font options.
- `StarChars` / `PoreChars` / `BlotchChars` — cork-texture char pools.

Edit any of those, rebuild, and the whole app picks up the new values
(help panel + menu + cycle included).
